# Eurorack Control Patches

These are a set of patches, written in Max/MSP and TouchOSC to execute computer control of Eurorack format synthesizers.

These require the use of a DC coupled interface and floating ring cables.  Or an interface capable of sending direct Eurorack level CV to the instrument (such as an ES-8).  More information regarding this technology and implementation can be found in the liner notes of the respective pieces, or by contacting me directly.

<b>Automatic Synthesis</b> is automated sending of control voltages, without performer interaction.

<b>Automatic Typing</b> allows the performer to open up various gates of randomized control voltage, using the computer's keyboard.

<b>OSC Euro Control</b> is a variety of different tools for control, including a TouchOSC patch for routing and live manipulation.
